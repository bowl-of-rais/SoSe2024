assignment: codegen for algebraic expressions

>[!info] **operator subscripts are compiled** into byte code (easier) or machine code (more efficient)
>- code generation frameworks

# LLVM

>[!goal] strongly typed, unbounded number of registers, single static assignment (SSA) form

- SSA makes data flow analysis much easier

```
fak(x)
	int r
	if x > 1
		r = fak(x-1) * x
	else
		r = 1
	return r
```

- ugt: unsigned greater than
- if true: jump to L1
- `%4` : r1, r in branch 1
- `phi`: if coming from L1, take %4, if coming from L2, take 1

#### For loop

```
for x = 1..10
	print (x)
```

```llvm
entry:
	br % loop
loop:
	%x = phi [1, %entry] [%n, %loop]
	print (%x)
	%n = %x + 1
	%c = %n <= 10
	br %c, %loop, %done
```

- alternative: pass argument to `loop`. but: less efficient

#### Scalar expressions

- most operations are simple
- minimize: branching, function calls, compile time

# Data-centric query execution

## Motivation

traditionally: **iterator model
- follow tree structure, start with root
- doesn't give any info on how to execute things

>[!int] ideally: avoid read/writes, keep data in CPU registers
>- code should consider this

> instead of iterating, execute pipelines in sequence

## Strategy

1. producing operators loop over materialized tuples
2. tuples loaded into CPU registers
3. go through pipeline
4. then materialize at end of pipeline

>[!int] maximize code + data locality -> tight loops

## Producing the code

produce/consume interface: only *conceptual*
- `produce` generates code to make output tuples
- `consume` generates code to accept input tuples

translation scheme:

| operation | produce            | consume |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| join      | produce both sides |         |
