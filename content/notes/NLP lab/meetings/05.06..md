- beware of focusing too much on fine-tuning one thing
- fine-tune in small steps, with small subsets of data
	- should not take several hours
- check out biobert tutorial
- check what aspects should be fine-tuned
	- see paper
	- enable autograd (gradient clipping) to save memory
	- dropout layers!!
	- padding etc less important
	- huggingface fine-tuning tutorial: how to test for different params
	- tune 1 thing at a time
- deadline: probably end of july
	- classical conference poster
	- qr code for sources
	- tum has templates?
- paper afterwards (mid-september?)
- predict cause first? -> start with binary first, see whether its 50/50
	- empty spans as cause/effect
- dummy category for no-relations (makes for easier generalization, normal texts also have )
