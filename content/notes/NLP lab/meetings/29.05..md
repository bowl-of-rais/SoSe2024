transfer learning both ways
- either from general to specific
- or from specific to general

options
- labeling learnable
- question answering - domain gaps

depends on dataset


----

biocause - pretty big and used a lot
- transfer annotations to other, smaller datasets?
- general, or at least general scientific language?
- solve issue of few annotated datasets

----

IDEA

fine-tuning:
- baseline general BERT
- combine: general vs domain-specific BERT, general vs domain-specific causal relations
- maybe add pattern recognition later
