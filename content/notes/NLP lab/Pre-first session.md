# General topic description

Causality is a complex challenge within the area of Natural Language Processing and specifically in the subarea of Argumentation mining. Depending on the different domain, causality opposes different challenges to the models based on the "definition" of causality. The aim of the project is to experiment with text out of natural sciences and finding causal explanations within this specific domain.

- appropriate datasets for scientific domains?
	- more bias detection? or just finding confounders
