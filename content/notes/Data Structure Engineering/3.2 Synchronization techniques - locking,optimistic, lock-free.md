```cpp
int global = 0;

void thread1() {
	while (true) {
		while (global%2 == 1); // wait
		printf("ping\n");
		global++;
	}
}

void thread2() {
	while (true) {
		while (global%2 == 0); // wait
		printf("pong\n");
		global++;
	}
}
```

different outcomes possible:
- global variable loaded only once
- assumption that variable is not shared

## Atomics

>[!imp] in C++: multiple threads accessing a shared variable == race condition == UB

to avoid this: use a `std::atomic` for atomic load/store and well-defined ordering (more later)

**compare-and-swap** (CAS): 
- `bool std::atomic_compare_exchange_strong(T& expected, T desired)`
- if value is `expected`, it is set to `desired`

```cpp
x = 5
expected = 4
x.cas(expected, 6) // returns false
// expected = 5
```

- `weak` version: may fail

**exchange**:
- `std::exchange(T desired)` returns previous value

arithmetic and logic operations also possible

#### Naive Spinlock

with exchange:

```cpp
struct NaiveSpinlock {
	std::atomic<int> data;  // indicates whether locked or not

	NaiveSpinlock() : data(0) {}

	void lock() {
		while (data.exchange(1)==1);  // changes value to 1
		// checks previous value
		// if it was 1: already locked -> while-loop
		// if it was 0: we locked it -> finish
	}

	void unlock() {
		data.store(0); // same as data = 0
	}
};
```

with CAS:

```cpp
struct NaiveSpinlock {
	std::atomic<int> data;
	NaiveSpinlock() : data(0) {}

	void lock() {
		int expected;
		do {
			expected = 0; // assume unlocked
			// reset bc cas sets it to 1
		} while (!data.compare_exchange_strong(expected, 1));
	}
	
	void unlock() {
		data.store(0); // same as data = 0
	}
};
```

#### Sequential consistency

>[!goal] when code is executed in the written order

- compiler guarantee
- default in C++
- non-atomic loads and stores are not reordered around atomics, atomics are not reordered with each other

##### `memory_order` parameters
- `release`: for deferring stores, other instructions are executed in the meantime
	- basically write buffer
