- attention...?
- scaling has stopped. actually: [@kaplan2020scaling]
- beyond autoregression (TODO: rewatch)
- architecture becomes irrelevant, more important: how to condition, synergistic tasks
- multi-modality, multi-linguality
- using pre-trained LLMs

# Research Directions

- prompting, auto-prompting
- fine-tuning
- post-hoc XAI
- robustness
- low-resource languages
- [RAG](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/), grounding
- evaluation
- multi-modality
