We treat it as a regression-based approach, by taking advantage of a pre-trained language model in order to represent the textual content, and by enriching the representation with domain-specific ontology-based entities and relations. We emulate an entity-based approach by comparing different types of input: raw text, extracted entities and a triple-based reformulation of the document content. For our experimental setup, we utilize the single freely available dataset of forged receipts, and we provide a deep analysis of our results in regard to the efficiency of our methods. Our findings show interesting correlations between the types of ontology relations (e.g., has{\_}address, amounts{\_}to), types of entities (product, company, etc.) and the performance of a regression-based language model that could help to study the transfer learning from natural language processing (NLP) methods to boost the performance of existing fraud detection systems.",

Numerous applications of the growing need for efficient and accurate causality mining include question answering, future events predication, discourse comprehension, decision making, scenario generation, medical text mining, and textual entailment. Although causality has long been in the spotlight, but there are still issues that need to be addressed. This study provides a comprehensive review of casualty mining for various application domains available in the new-age literature from 1989 to 2022. We searched and rigorously examined numerous papers in the most reliable libraries for the review, and the terminologies that drive the context are described. Each paper underwent a thorough review process to extract the following meta-data: techniques, target domains, datasets, features, and limits of each approach. This meta-data will aid researchers in selecting the strategy that is most suited to their research needs. The literature is divided into three groups based on critical reviews including traditional, machine learning-based, and deep learning-based approaches. A concise taxonomy that can substantially help new scholars comprehend the field is developed. In order to make it simple for new researchers to start their research, various perspectives and suggestions are offered.}

    abstract = "Can language models read biomedical texts and explain the biomedical mechanisms discussed? In this work we introduce a biomedical mechanism summarization task. Biomedical studies often investigate the mechanisms behind how one entity (e.g., a protein or a chemical) affects another in a biological context. The abstracts of these publications often include a focused set of sentences that present relevant supporting statements regarding such relationships, associated experimental evidence, and a concluding sentence that summarizes the mechanism underlying the relationship. We leverage this structure and create a summarization task, where the input is a collection of sentences and the main entities in an abstract, and the output includes the relationship and a sentence that summarizes the mechanism. Using a small amount of manually labeled mechanism sentences, we train a mechanism sentence classifier to filter a large biomedical abstract collection and create a summarization dataset with 22k instances. We also introduce conclusion sentence generation as a pretraining task with 611k instances. We benchmark the performance of large bio-domain language models. We find that while the pretraining task help improves performance, the best model produces acceptable mechanism outputs in only 32{\%} of the instances, which shows the task presents significant challenges in biomedical language understanding and summarization.",

In this paper, we propose the task of logical fallacy detection, and provide a new dataset (Logic) of logical fallacies generally found in text, together with an additional challenge set for detecting logical fallacies in climate change claims (LogicClimate). Detecting logical fallacies is a hard problem as the model must understand the underlying logical structure of the argument. We find that existing pretrained large language models perform poorly on this task. In contrast, we show that a simple structure-aware classifier outperforms the best language model by 5.46{\%} F1 scores on Logic and 4.51{\%} on LogicClimate. We encourage future work to explore this task since (a) it can serve as a new reasoning challenge for language models, and (b) it can have potential applications in tackling the spread of misinformation.

In addition to building a framework to collect a dataset of Mafia game records, we demonstrate that there are differences in the language produced by players with different roles. We confirm that classification models are able to rank deceptive players as more suspicious than honest ones based only on their use of language. Furthermore, we show that training models on two auxiliary tasks outperforms a standard BERT-based text classification approach. We also present methods for using our trained models to identify features that distinguish between player roles, which could be used to assist players during the Mafia game.",

In Subtask 2, participants were challenged to identify the Cause, Effect, and Signal spans given an input causal sentence. For both subtasks, participants uploaded their predictions for a held-out test set, and ranking was done based on binary F1 and macro F1 scores for Subtask 1 and 2, respectively. This paper includes an overview of the work of the ten teams that submitted their results to our competition and the six system description papers that were received. The highest F1 scores achieved for Subtask 1 and 2 were 84.66{\%} and 72.79{\%}, respectively.",

    abstract = "Despite the importance of understanding causality, corpora addressing causal relations are limited. There is a discrepancy between existing annotation guidelines of event causality and conventional causality corpora that focus more on linguistics. Many guidelines restrict themselves to include only explicit relations or clause-based arguments. Therefore, we propose an annotation schema for event causality that addresses these concerns. We annotated 3,559 event sentences from protest event news with labels on whether it contains causal relations or not. Our corpus is known as the Causal News Corpus (CNC). A neural network built upon a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model performed well with 81.20{\%} F1 score on test set, and 83.46{\%} in 5-folds cross-validation. CNC is transferable across two external corpora: CausalTimeBank (CTB) and Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB). Leveraging each of these external datasets for training, we achieved up to approximately 64{\%} F1 on the CNC test set without additional fine-tuning. CNC also served as an effective training and pre-training dataset for the two external corpora. Lastly, we demonstrate the difficulty of our task to the layman in a crowd-sourced annotation exercise. Our annotated corpus is publicly available, providing a valuable resource for causal text mining researchers.",

      abstract = {Event Relation Identification (ERI) aims at mining the inter-event dependencies expressed in event-mentioned sentences. The main challenge of this task lies in recognizing the implicit clue for utterances without context words indicating the relation definitely. When confronting a lack of training samples, mainstream techniques fail to efficiently capture the subtle relations between events because the parameters of neural networks cannot be adequately fitted. Although there is a rising trend of using prompt learning to alleviate such issues, existing methods lack optimization of the prompt and prompts-tuning process. These deficiencies lead to two weaknesses: co-occurrence interference and amphibolous prompting. To this end, this paper proposes a Constrained Prefix ATTention mechanism (CPATT) and incorporates it into the traditional prompt-tuning process. In this fashion, our approach integrates context semantic features into dynamic prompts to mitigate co-occurrence interference. Moreover, CPATT supervises the guide effect of prompts via incorporating mutual exclusivity between categories into the loss function. The experimental results on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines, including GPT3.5-turbo, in terms of intra- and inter-sentence event relation identification tasks.}

      abstractNote={Event causality identification (ECI) aims to identify the
causal relationship between events, which plays a crucial role
in deep text understanding. Due to the diversity of real-world
causality events and difficulty in obtaining sufficient training
data, existing ECI approaches have poor generalizability and
struggle to identify the relation between seldom seen events.
In this paper, we propose to utilize both external knowledge
and internal analogy to improve ECI. On the one hand, we
utilize a commonsense knowledge graph called ConceptNet
to enrich the description of an event sample and reveal the
commonalities or associations between different events. On
the other hand, we retrieve similar events as analogy exam-
ples and glean useful experiences from such analogous neigh-
bors to better identify the relationship between a new event
pair. By better understanding different events through exter-
nal knowledge and making an analogy with similar events, we
can alleviate the data sparsity issue and improve model gener-
alizability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets
show that our model outperforms other baseline methods by
around 18% on the F1-value on average},

To resolve these limitations, we build the Webis-Causality-23 dataset, with sophisticated inputs (all units from arguments), a balanced distribution of causality types, and a larger number of linguistic patterns denoting causality. The dataset contains 1485 examples derived by combining the two paradigms of distant supervision and uncertainty sampling to identify diverse, high-quality samples of causality relations, and annotate them in a cost-effective manner.",
