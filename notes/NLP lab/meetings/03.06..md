>[!hyp] To what extent does transfer learning from general text corpora to domain-specific texts enhance the extraction of causal relationships by BERT and BioBERT models?

fine-tuning:
- baseline general BERT
- combine: general vs domain-specific BERT, general vs domain-specific causal relations
- maybe add pattern recognition later

# Main Resources

datasets: 
- BioCause [@mihuailua2013biocause]
- general \[[Repository](https://github.com/webis-de/sigdial23-causality-corpus/blob/main/dataset/all_aggregated_relations_type_checked.tsv)\] \[[Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2023.sigdial-1.31/)\] 

models:
- BERT
- BioBERT [@lee2020biobert]

# Plan

- pre-process BioCause annotations
	- same annotation as with general
- find out how to use/fine-tune models
	- research a few different methods?
