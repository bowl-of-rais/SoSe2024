# Physical Data Layout

### Lightweight

simple arrays: without buffer manager
##### Row-wise

##### Column-wise

##### Example

```sql
SELECT SUM(SALARY) from table
```

- more efficient with column-wise store
- sequential access, plus all data that is accessed is also used

##### Compromise

- store column by column in page
