# HyPer: Virtual Memory Snapshots

##### Problems
- unix-only
- `fork` is slow (makes a copy of page table, which is especially large for large memory sizes)
	- trade-off: large page table with slow fork vs smaller page table with slow copy-on-writes
	- idea: make page-table copy-on-write too

# In-memory index structures

1. **hash indexes**: expensive growth. do not listen to the lies of Big O.
2. **search trees**: binary is evil -> b-trees
	- exception: very large keys, need for pointer stability
3. **radix-trees**: range queries, height independent from number of entries

# HTM for OLTP

**HTM**: [hardware transactional memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_memory#Hardware_vs._software)
- group instructions to transaction -> makes group atomic

##### Problems

![[Pasted image 20240709150039.png|350]]
- limits: size of L1 cache, number of hash buckets

- other stuff, os etc

>everything bad that happens in the background kills you too

# Compaction

## Hot/Cold Clustering

### Detecting temperature

1. LRU, counters (software)
2. `mprotect` and wait: page fault when write
3. `dirty`/`young` flags in page table (already knows these things)
