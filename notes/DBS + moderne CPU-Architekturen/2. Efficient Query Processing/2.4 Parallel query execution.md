**inter-query parallelism**: multiple queries concurrently

**intra-query parallelism**: parallelize single query
- horizontal: independent sub plans in parallel
- vertical: parallelize operators

# Exchange operator

>[!int] operator that encapsulates parallelism, starts threads, buffers data

-> other operators can remain largely unchanged

- invented for distributed engines

## Variants

- `Xchg(N:M)`
- `XchgUnion(N:1)`
- `XchgDynamicSplit(1:M)`
- `XchgHashSplit(N:M)`
- `XchgBroadcast(N:M)`
- `XchgRangeSplit(N:M)`

## Examples

##### select, then groupby

1. select + groupby partitions -> partial aggregates, then another groupby/aggregate
	- sum: trivial
	- average: split into sum and count, compute those first
	- all aggregates can be decomposed, yay
2. select in partitions, then `XchgHashSplit` (each group only ends up in one partition), then groupby in parallel
	- few groups: version 1 is better, many groups: version 2 is better
3. select + (partially) groupby partitions, then `XchgHashSplit`, then re-aggregate
	- partial groupby: compute finite number of groups. if too many: flush, new groups

##### select, then join

2. select in R, then broadcast, join with S, then union

##### Misc

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT X) GROUP BY Y
```
- internally: groupby (x, y) -> removes duplicates
- then count

>[!imp] queries should be cancellable -> difficult

## Disadvantages

- static system: load imbalances
- number of threads cannot be changed mid-query
- lots of of overhead (context switching, copied tuples)

# Parallel Query Engine

>[!idea] **parallelize operators**
>- needs synced data structures, but has more flexibility

## Morsel-Driven Query Execution

**morsel**: constant-size work units, SMALL (<10k tuples)
- dynamically assigned to worker threads
- \\# worker threads = # hardware threads

avoiding stragglers:
- **dynamic work stealing**
