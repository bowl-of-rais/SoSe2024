- B-trees: what exactly does clustering mean in this context
- how does bulk update of B-trees work?
	- naive version would be to read out leaves from existing tree, merge with new entries and then do bulk tree creation...
	- wdym new chunk???
- what were the advantages of b-trees again?
- query operators: how exactly are registers implemented?
	- in the exercise they were called registers but we still used references to the tuples, right?
	- is the difference that when there's a pipeline break/aggregate, the materialized tuples are also stored in some global space instead of within the operator?
