- multiple choice questions are possible
- both theoretical + practical questions
	- eg runtimes of data structures, how to implement
- 90min written exam
- some code possible (slides + exercises)
- latency figures (hardware slides): depends on CPU architectures, don't have to be memorized exactly. but vaguely.
- c++ code: read+write, does not have to be 100% exact, but at a reasonable level of accuracy
	- things like references are important depending on context

prep tips
- lecture + exercise materials!
- coding assignments
- start with quiz questions

### Hashing

fill factor: n/m, entries/buckets

good hash function:
- maps expected distribution over domain to approx uniform distritbution
- as fast as possible
- (ideal: arbitrary distribution, but not really possible)

tabulation: (not a focus but still)
- probabilistic guarantees: generalized over families of hash functions
