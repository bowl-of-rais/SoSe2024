- height depends on key length $k$ instead of size $n$
- deterministic structure
- lexicographic order
- keys contained in paths (no need to store them again)

# Spans

>[!int] look at $s$ bits in each node

- inner nodes: array of $2^s$ pointers
- trade-off: larger $s$ has small height, but larger space consumption, smaller $s$ have larger height, but smaller space consumption

# [Adaptive Radix Tree](https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/ART.pdf)

>[!int] nodes have adaptive layout, span still fixed

- $s=8$: 1 byte of key mapped to next child
- different node size based on how many children

#### Node256

- direct addressing

![[Pasted image 20240523111445.png]]

#### Node4, Node16

- 2 arrays: keys and child pointers
- simd

![[Pasted image 20240523111502.png]]

#### Node48

- indirect addressing
- first array: 256 offsets -> shorter than actual pointers. can be done in 1 byte, yay for space efficiency
	- direct access, no search
- second array: 48 entries

#### Combination

![[Pasted image 20240523112241.png]]

#### Leaf nodes

- single or multiple values depending on data

# Height Optimization/Patricia Trie

>[!goal] remove nodes with only 1 child

>[!idea] path compression: merge one-way node into child
>- add prefix

>[!idea] lazy expansion: similar but put everything in leaf

# Space Consumption

best case: 8.1B per key for dense integers
worst case:

>[!int] consider tries as decision trees

increased bit span:
- "look further into the future"
- can also be adaptive

adaptive nodes:
- TODO

#### k-constrained tries

>[!idea] fix maximum fanout $k$ instead of span

![[Pasted image 20240606105030.png]]

#### Implementation

- binary subtrees -> slow search
- linearize to bit string
	- partial keys: skip non-discriminative bits
	- can be compared using SIMD
	- sparse partial keys: only store bits used in navigation + positions

actual layouts:

![[Pasted image 20240606111554.png]]

- explicitly store which bits are used
- or store masks (extraction can be done with a single instruction)
- and for very long keys: use multiple masks ( `_pext_u64()` for extracting from multiple 64bit integers)
